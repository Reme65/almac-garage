Final Reflection

As a qualified vehicle mechanic, I drew on my real-world experience to design a website that is both authentic and user-friendly. In my professional career, I turned a struggling fast-fit centre into a garage where customers, particularly women, felt confident bringing their vehicles for honest, professional service without fear of overcharging or patronising advice.

Applying this experience to the website, I ensured that all services listed are accurate and reflect genuine garage operations. I structured the site to be clear and accessible, with intuitive navigation and straightforward language, so that users of all backgrounds can quickly understand the services offered and how to book.

I also made deliberate design choices, such as unique header colours per page and a clean layout, to help users orient themselves and reinforce trust. This project taught me how to translate my professional knowledge into a digital medium while keeping within the scope of beginner-level HTML and CSS, and it strengthened my ability to consider user experience in a practical context.
